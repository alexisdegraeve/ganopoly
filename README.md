## Game Description

In Ganopoly, four players (one human and three computer-controlled opponents) compete to accumulate wealth, buy properties, and avoid bankruptcy in a vibrant world influenced by the spirit and iconography of Ganesha.

## Rules (based on Monopoly™)

- Each player starts with an initial amount of money.
- Players take turns rolling two dice and moving around the board.
- Landing on an unowned property gives the player the opportunity to purchase it.
- If the property is owned, the player must pay rent to the owner.
- Special squares include: "Go" (collect money), "Chance", "Community Chest", "Jail", "Free Parking", and "Go to Jail".
- Players can build houses and temples (instead of hotels) to increase the rent value.
- If a player runs out of money and cannot pay their debts, they are declared bankrupt and eliminated from the game.
- The last player remaining is declared the winner!

## Players

- **Player 1**: Human player
- **Players 2-4**: AI-controlled players (computer opponents)
